# React Performance Lab

To run:
```
npm run dev
```

#### To Do

Implement the following examples, showing how each affects rendering.
- Implement example with memoization, showing how it affects rendering.
- Implement example with `useSelector`.
- Go through this [visual guide](https://alexsidorenko.com/blog/react-render-always-rerenders), and implement other examples that seem useful. 
- Big idea: make this a learning experience site, complete with explanations and chapters. Maybe have a side bar with chapters, then each chapter has an explanation of what's happening, in addition to the visual representation.
